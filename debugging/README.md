## Description

Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

Welcome to a specialized module of our IT curriculum where we explore innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices. This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development: debugging and automation. By engaging with these tasks, you’ll learn how to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT to not only identify and resolve errors more efficiently but also to automate repetitive coding tasks, thereby increasing your productivity and improving the quality of your code.

### Objectives

- **Debugging**: Understand the practical use of AI in identifying and solving coding errors. You will use ChatGPT to diagnose and correct bugs in provided code samples across multiple programming languages. This will enhance your problem-solving skills and understanding of common programming pitfalls in a diverse set of coding environments.
- **Automation**: Learn how to automate mundane and repetitive coding tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT. This involves generating boilerplate code, documentation, and even basic unit tests, freeing up time to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software development.

### Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills**: Gain confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, with an ability to articulate problems clearly and implement AI-driven solutions effectively.
- **Automation Proficiency**: Develop skills to leverage AI for automating coding tasks, leading to more structured and error-free code.

Through this project, you will engage in hands-on activities that reflect real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of traditional coding methods with AI integration. This approach not only prepares you for future technological advancements but also equips you with skills that are increasingly in demand in the tech industry. Get ready to transform the way you code by making it smarter, faster, and more efficient!

**Note**: Remember to test, verify, and critically evaluate the information provided by ChatGPT. Don’t hesitate to question or double-check the responses to ensure their accuracy and relevance to your needs.

## Tasks

### 0. Debugging - Python Factorial
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

The provided code should calculate the factorial of a number passed as a command-line argument but encounters a `KeyboardInterrupt` error. Fix the code to correctly print the factorial of the argument.

**Test File**: `factorial.py`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `factorial.py`

### 1. Debugging - Python Arguments
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

The provided code prints all command-line arguments, including the script name. Fix the code to print only the arguments without the script name.

**Test File**: `print_arguments.py`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `print_arguments.py`

### 2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

The provided code intends to change the background color of a webpage when a button is clicked but contains an error. Fix the code to ensure the background color changes on button click.

**Test File**: `change_background.html`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `change_background.html`

### 3. Debugging - Python Mines
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

**Game Overview**: Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player must clear a field of hidden “mines” without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. Fix the code to implement a mechanism to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed, thus winning the game.

**Test File**: `mines.py`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `mines.py`

### 4. Documentation - Python Factorial
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to document the code.

The provided code calculates the factorial of a number recursively. Add documentation with three sections: function description, parameters, and returns.

**Test File**: `factorial_recursive.py`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `factorial_recursive.py`

### 5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to document the code.

The provided code simulates a checkbook but crashes on non-numeric inputs. Fix the code to include error handling mechanisms to prevent crashes due to invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values).

**Test File**: `checkbook.py`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `checkbook.py`

### 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
**Objective**: Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.

**Game Overview**: Players alternate placing “X” or “O” on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. Fix all errors in the code, ensuring robust handling of user inputs.

**Test File**: `tic.py`

**Repo**:
- GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction`
- Directory: `debugging`
- File: `tic.py`
